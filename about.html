        <em>tinder on: gun control</em>, created in March 2018, is an online zine focusing on issues of gun control, school shooting, and censorship 🚫🔫🙅

        Like one could imagine, Tinder profiles are varied and appeal to various interests. Users photos of themselves with pets (more commonly 🐶), cars 🚗💨, pool tables 🎱, food 🍕 and more. Among the many profiles I swiped through, I came across gun-owners on Tinder.

        Prior to this project, I never thought to engage with gun-owners due to my own personal preconceptions. I had a growing collection of screenshots not sure what to do with the content. However, on February 14, my attitude changed. A gunman opened fire and killed 17 students and staff members at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. This incited national calls for gun control. Online, Bumble🐝 announced plans to ban images of firearms and gun-related content. To my knowledge, Tinder has not done the same. I saw this as an opportunity to start a conversation 🗣💬 between myself and gun-owners.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        I asked my matches the same question: “What’s your stance on gun control?” 🤔
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        The responses varied; some were shorter than others. The goal of this zine is to display the wide range of opinion amongst gun-owners and to consider about one’s online identity.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        To protect the identity of these men, all faces, locations, and names were removed 👥.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        All responses and profiles remain unedited.
